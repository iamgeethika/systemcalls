                                         SYSTEM - LINUX



## ```QUESTION-1``` ##

* We can compile this using 

* ``
gcc q1.c
``

* And execute using

* ``
./a.out <input_file_path>
``

* ``
Output File is named as 1_<input_file_name>
``

* Here, we are reversing the contents of the file and store the result in a new file in the directory named "Assignment"








## ```QUESTION-2:``` ##




* We can compile this using 

* ``
gcc q2.c
``

* And execute using

* ``
./a.out <input_file_path> start_char end_char
``

* ``
Output File is named as 2_<input_file_name>
``

* Here, we are reversing a specific portion of the file and store the result in a new file in the directory named “Assignment”








## ```QUESTION-3:``` ##




* Here we are checking the permissions for the NEWFILE, OLDFILE, DIRECTORY

* Also, we are checking whether the content in the NEWFILE are the reverse of the OLDFILE

* We can compile this using 

* ``
gcc q3.c
``

* And execute using

* ``
./a.out <newfile> <oldfile> <directory>
``
